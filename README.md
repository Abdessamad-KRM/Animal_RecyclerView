# 🐾 TP05 – My Animal List App

Hi! 👋  
This is a small Android app I made while learning **Kotlin** and **RecyclerView**.  
It shows a list of animals, and you can:
- See details about each animal 🦁
- Delete animals with a confirmation ❌
- Change how the list looks (linear or grid) 🔄

---

## 📱 What You Can Do in the App

✨ **Main Features:**
- 📋 View a list of animals with name, species, and image
- 🟩 Switch between **List View** and **Grid View**
- 💬 Click **Details** to open a popup with more info
- ⚠️ Click **Delete** to remove an animal (after confirmation)
- 🔔 See small messages (Toasts) for user feedback

| **Kotlin** | The main programming language |
| **RecyclerView** | To display the list of animals |
| **AlertDialog** | To show details and confirmation popups |
